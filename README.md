# Formal Methods in Security and Privacy
This course focuses on proving program correctness and its various properties
using the EasyCrypt proof assistant

# Structure
This repo contains:
* Assignments (located in the Assingmnents folder)
* Labs (Located in the Labs folder)
* My work in progress Semester Project (Located in the Project folder)

# Commands
In order to run EasyCrypt you would need Emacs and Proof General installed.
A lot of poeple arent comfortable with Emacs and if that sounds like you
then I'd highly recommend still using it since being a pro at Emacs is not necessary to work in Proof General.

Easycrypt files have a .ec extension to suggest easycrypt-mode in proof general.

You can run the proofs in batch mode or check it line-by-line. I recommend the latter.

In addition I have put a simple file in the main branch that you can run to test
if EasyCrypt has been installed on your system.
